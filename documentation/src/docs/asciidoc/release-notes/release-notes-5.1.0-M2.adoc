=== JUnit Platform

==== Bug Fixes

* Summary table is no longer printed via the `ConsoleLauncher` and Gradle plugin when
  details mode `NONE` is selected, unless there are errors.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* New `SUMMARY` details mode for the `ConsoleLauncher` and Gradle plugin which prints
  the table of success and failure counts at the end of test plan execution. This new
  mode is analogous to the previous behavior of the `NONE` details mode.


[[release-notes-5.1.0-M2-junit-jupiter]]
=== JUnit Jupiter

==== Bug Fixes

* The current module layer is now used when scanning for test classes within modules. The
  current module layer is the one that the class loader for the `ModuleUtils` class
  returns. If the current layer cannot be obtained, the algorithm falls back to the boot
  layer.

==== Deprecations and Breaking Changes

* ❓

==== New Features and Improvements

* New callback interface `CloseableResource` introduced in `ExtensionContext.Store`.
  An extension context store is bound to its extension context lifecycle. When an
  extension context lifecycle ends it closes its associated store. All stored values
  that are instances of `ExtensionContext.Store.CloseableResource` are notified by
  invoking their `close()` method.
